1. Test out how actions are impacted by the target (i.e. magnitudes pushing back on each other)
2. Start thinking about objects... do they have genes? What are their characteristics?
    a. Characteristics = Things like strength, health, speed, smart... NEED TO BE EMERGENT
    b. How do subjects and objects differ in that regard?
3. Build out basics in Entity/Subject/Object components
4. Plan out how actions have effects (i.e. how the result of the action influences characteristics - increase/decrease)
5. Finish the result of actions (i.e. actually creating/destroying/consume/produce... may need to impact more than just characteristics - like for create)
